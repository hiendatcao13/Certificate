a place stores all Cao Hien Dat's certificates



Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope this text finds you well.

I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience, but I regret to inform you that I have <strong>misplaced my scholarship certificate</strong> and am unable to provide a copy at this time. I understand that this document is important for the evaluation process, and I truly appreciate your understanding. 

I would be glad to provide alternative proof, such as official confirmation from my university.

Once again, I apologize for the inconvenience, and I appreciate your time and consideration.

Best regards,

Dat
